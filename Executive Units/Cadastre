- Cadastre shall be stored and operated in a decentralised manner similar to non fungible tokens
- Land property data would contain the GEO data, the list of the alpha citizen owning it and the list of ones renting it. 
- It should be possible to split lands into a small fractional unit.
- Securing the cadastral network by joining the decentralised network should be publically accessible and there should be incentives in doing so
- Most other properties like houses, business shares, and other posessions should have a similar template
