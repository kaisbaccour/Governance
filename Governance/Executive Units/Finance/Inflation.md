```
In traditional economies, high inflation is considered dangerous due to structural rigidity and poor adaptability:

- **Salaries adjust slowly**, creating a persistent lag behind rising prices. This erodes real income and quality of life.
- **Negotiations are infrequent**, and often manual. Many workers are locked into contracts that don't respond quickly to macroeconomic changes.
- **Cash-based systems suffer technical delays**, requiring physical reprinting of currency and adjustment of denominations.
- **Institutional latency** and central planning bottlenecks prevent timely correction.

This system does not inheretly consider inflation because theoretically if prices double and salaries double then no meaningful harm occurs. It assumes that salary and sales negociations are handled by opensource negociating algorithms that dynamically negociate salaries by taking supply and demand into account. 
```
- The system operates in a **fully digital economy**, where salaries, prices, and budgets can be dynamically adjusted.
- Citizens receive **real-time universal income** which adjusts to cost of living, this ensures that no group of people would struggle. 
```
What matters is not whether prices rise but whether **humans can still live well** under those prices. And this system ensures they can.
