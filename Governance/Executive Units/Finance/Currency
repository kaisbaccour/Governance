## Citizen Payouts
- Each verified Alpha Citizen receives a continuous payout of every second (universal salary).
- All Alpha Citizens receive the same salary regardless of their current financial situation (rich or poor) receive the same (easier to implements with less flaws. No need to control)
- Payout is unconditional and not tied to economic activity.
- Payouts are programmable (on-chain) and transparent.
- The payout amount dynamically changes based on a standard of living. Decentralised Oracles control this amount.
- Payouts come from minted money. Inflation in this system is by design not an issue( This model adopts new assumptions that make inflation not an issue )
