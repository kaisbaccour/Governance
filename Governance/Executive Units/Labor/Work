- To encourage flexibility of work and prevent traditional employers abuse, commuting time should be considered part of the job. This should promote remote working and fairness when commuting is required.

Example: The commuting time of an employee from home to office is 1 hour (2 hours round trip) and the employee's contract is 8 hours a day, then the employee is only obliged to work 6hours in the office. 

- Payments should happen via a vesting-like schedule, where every second the employee gets paid with a linearly growing piece of their salary. This should make the payment trustless on both parties, the employer and the employee

Example: An employer hires an employee for a 1 month contract with a total payment of 2.628.000 units. the employee should start receiving 1 unit per second. because there are 2.628.000 seconds per month.
