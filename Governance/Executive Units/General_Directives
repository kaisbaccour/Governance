#Requests submitted from businesses and alpha citizens to executive units.
- Privilegiate as much as possible systemic requests. Requests should be accepted or denied instantaneously.
- Prefer the use of smart contracts for the purpose of request submissions.
- When requests are not possible, aim for a systemic administration with no human judgement involved. follow a set of predefined conditions and evaluate accordingly with a provable outcome.
