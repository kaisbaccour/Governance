#This could be similar in trad Governance to a parliamentarian or a representative


- A Representative's voting power is the sum of all the votes delegated to them.
- For any proposal, an alpha citizen can override the vote of their respective representative by actively voting to the proposal.
- Delegates do not represent people based on their localisation but instead based on the amount of votes they get from the entire ecosystem/country.
- Voting for Delegates is not choosing one person but instead distributing 10 voting points to a set of alpha citizens/candidates. It is possible to give all 10 points to the same candidate but it is also possible to spread your voting power to more candidates.
- To become a candidate, an alpha citizen simply needs to collect at least 1 voting power point(They can also vote for themselves and become candidates)
- Alpha citizens and Delegates cannot vote to ban a representative, however voters for a specific representative can vote to ban their own representatives. (This will make sure the minority stays represented even when the majority is opposed to that). The quorum is then calculated relatively to the representative voting power
- Delegates are voted on for a specific mandate and they need to get reelected to keep their position.
- Voting for Delegates is a continuous routine, every representative has their own voting power, starting date and expiry date of a mandate to be renewed with votes
- submitting a proposal and not getting to a minimum voting quorum will disallow the alpha citizen from submitting any proposal for a period of time. (This will avoid spam).
- The number of Delegates is set by voting but can be initialised to 100
- Delegates votes are transparent to the public
- Delegates have incentives in being Delegates by getting a budget voted on by the voters. The delegators could abuse this to increase their budget but if they do so alpha citizens can still override their votes.
- Delegates have to vote on all proposals that pass the quorum and all proposals submitted by the Justice.
