#This could be similar in traditional Governance to ministers

- Voters as decribed in "Governance.Voting" can vote to add, change or remove an executive.
- The executive fully operates the unit they operate in (Health, Finance ...).
- Executives are voted for a specific mandate and they need to get reelected to keep their positions.
- Any internal law within an executive unit should be transparent and can be vetoed by the voters
- The only duty of the executing units is to release compliance and regulations that privately owned businesses or DAOs should comply to
- The executing units shall leave all the work to DAO and third party privately owned businesses:

Example:
Health: DAO health platforms, private hospitals, DAO hospitals.
Education: DAO Schools, private Universities.
Finance: Decentralised Finance protocols, Private banks, DAO insurance.

- All financial data/transactions regarding Governmental institutions shall be stored in a deecentralised manner.
- Joining the decentralised network of the Governmental institutions should be publicly accessible with incentives in doing so
- Employees working in the executive units earn shares in their executive respective unit. this will allow the unit's operators to be motivated. These shares can allow them to digitally vote on the internal laws of the executive unit.
