- In traditional Justice sentences get in general a one dimentional sentence almost looked at as a punishment. 
Alpha citizens do not get any punishments. Instead, they get a multi dimentional sentence only to bring justice to other Alpha citizens that have been impacted by the damages inflicted by the crime to them.

- There are 3 judicial dimensions: 
    - The Financial Dimension (to compensate the victims)
    - The Educational Dimension (To try to prevent the crime from recurring)
    - The Protection Dimension (To protect the Other Alpha citizens)

Any sentence can be composed of 1,2 or 3 dimensions depending on what damages the corresponding crime has caused.

### judicial Dimensions 
- The Financial Dimension: The sentence should be a simple calculation of all financial damages inflicted to all Alpha citizens and institutions by the crime. 
Any time spent on this case by any victim or thirdparty institution, or computation energy should also be calculated (even approximately) and included in the amount to pay back.
Equally, If the crime touches all the members of ecosystem, the sentence would be to pay that sum to the ecosystem's common reserve fund.
- The Educational Dimension: This is a way to prevent the crime from happening again by enrolling the sentenced Alpha citizen in a specifc program related to the committed crime.
Example 1: If the crime was related to a driving crime, the Alpha citizen would have to enroll in a driving awareness program.
Example 2: If the crime was related to a Financial fraud, the Alpha citizen would have to enroll in some ethical financial training programs. And will need to pass some speicific exams and eventually spend a specific amount of hours on that.
- The Protection Dimension: The sentence should only be given to Alpha citizens that have inflicted or have tried and failed to inflict physical harm to another Alpha citizen.
They can be sentenced to a certain amount of isolation/jail for a certain amount of time.
The puropose here is not to be punished but to protect other Alpha citizens.
Example 1: If the crime was only related to a driving crime, the Alpha citizen shall not get any sentence within the Protection Dimension because they did not directly try to cause physical harm, however they can be banned from driving. 
Driving while being banned, however, can be considered as trial to cause physical damage to other Alpha citizens and can get a Protection Dimension sentence.
Example 2: If an Alpha citizen has only committed a financial crime, they shall not get any sentence within the Protection Dimension, because they have not proven to be of any physical harm to any other Alpha citizen.
#####
- Any crime that does not fall within these 3 dimensions is not a crime.
- A sentence cannot be a combination between dimensions. Every sentence has 3 uniquely separate outcomes.
Example 1: A financial Fraud crime will have 1 Financial Dimension sentence, 1 Educational Dimension sentence and 0 Protection Dimension sentence.


# Trustless systems
- The systems should be setup as much as possible in a way that it does not allow alpha citizens to cheat instead of trying to setup control systems to check after cheaters. 
Example 1:In traditional systems a citizen could get a signed official document from the government or can also falsify the document and falsly claim that it was signed by the government. 
A trustless system works with institutions that only accept cryptographically signed documents/certificates where it is mathematically not possible to falsify or cheat. 
- Whenever systems, protocols and procedures are being implemented, always privilegiate incentives over Control and sentences.
- Whenever it is possible to cheat, Alpha citizens should be incentivised not to cheat.
- When it is hard to incentivise Alpha citizens not to cheat and control is needed, Other Alpha citizens and institutions shall be financially incentivised to control them.
