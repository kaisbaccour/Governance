- The bootstrapping judges are initially voted on by the Delegates/Alpha citizens.
- Once the bootstrapping judges are in place, all the following judges will be voted on by the judges in place.
- Unlike the bootstrapping judges, candidates willing to become judges need to have the educational requirements in order to be eligible to be elected.
- Judges can be elected and discharged by other judges via votes.
- Judges cannot be elected but can be discharged by Delegates/Alpha citizens.
- Judges that are discharged will not get any newer cases but will get to keep all the current cases assigned to them. This will make sure that their dismissal is not done for the purpose of changing the course of a specific currenlty running case.
